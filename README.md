# RUCHE

Project **RUCHE** (acronym of **R**OS2-based **U**nified **C**ontrol for **H**ugging-face **E**mbodied-agents) is a project developed by the [B-AROL-O Team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) in response to "[MCP'st 1st Birthday](https://huggingface.co/MCP-1st-Birthday)" Hackathon.
This Hackathon is hosted by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) and [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) with additional support from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Modal](https://modal.com/), [Sambanova](https://sambanova.ai/), [IIElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), [Blaxel](https://blaxel.ai/), [Llamaindex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [Nebius](https://nebius.com/).

Incidentally, since [Ruché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruch%C3%A9) is a red [Italian wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wine) [grape variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape_variety) from the [Piedmont](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(wine)>) region, the name RUCHE was chosen to keep up with the naming convention of [B-AROL-O Team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) Open Source projects, following [ARNEIS](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS), [FREISA](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/FREISA), etc.
